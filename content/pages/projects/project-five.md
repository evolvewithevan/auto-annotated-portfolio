Often times I will be experimenting with new assets, different mediums, and new tools and end up turning what was just to be a simple test into a full-fledged, vinyl print quality artwork. These projects are often the most fun for me as they allow me to apply my skills to in a novel way that serves to stoke deep inspiration. This project is no exception to that. Starting with a new texture scanning setup to capture physical textures in over 5k resolution, I ended up turning pictures of stones into HDRI's for an experimental deep-sea render featuring a holographic-like, dreamy environment.
