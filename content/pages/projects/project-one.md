I was going through my old hard drive one day and found a program I wrote way back when I was still getting good at this stuff, and I realized it had so much unrealized potential. It was such a supple little hatchling at the time, and yet incredibly powerful. Feeling the need to give it a modern edge, I revived it from the dead and breathed new life into it, making it even more refined than ever.

Digging deep into the trenches of one of my old drives one day I saw the baby program waiting for love. At the time to use the program, I would have to dig into the raw code, changing individual integers hoping I didn't accidentally nuke it. I realized that I now actually have the skills to turn it into a proper program fit for a professionals tool belt. So I started working.![](/images/contact.jpg)
