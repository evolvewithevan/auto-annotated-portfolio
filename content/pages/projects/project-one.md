I was going through my old hard drive one day and found a program I wrote way back when I was still getting good at this stuff, and I realized it had so much unrealized potential. It was such a supple little hatchling at the time, and yet incredibly powerful. Feeling the need to give it a modern edge, I revived it from the dead and breathed new life into it, making it even more refined than ever.

Digging deep into the trenches of one of my old drives one day I saw the baby program waiting for love. At the time to use the program, I would have to dig into the raw code, changing individual integers hoping I didn't accidentally nuke it. I realized that now, I actually have the skills to turn it into a proper program fit for a professional. So I got to work.

Through brainstorming features, implementing them, trying them out, Coming up with more features, coding them, realizing I broke stuff, fixing the broken bits trying those out, and being inspired for even more novel ideas, I had ended up with a very feature-full script. This new script could turn 20 minutes of micro adjustments and tediousness, into 20 seconds of getting it right the first time. Now instead of changing every little variable dozens of times, I had the script set to be able to change these variables in very specific ways, saving myself from tons of mental math and risk of breaking things.

Now I was left with tackling the biggest imperfection. User Interface. I had built something extremely useful, but only to someone who has a solid chance of being able to understand what they are using. I added the libraries and framework. I started making buttons, options, previews and more previews. With nothing left to do but to plug everything together and pray it works, I did exactly that. It didn't. First it was simple things but then it turned into a weird series of problems I wouldnt even have expected to think about at the time. Eventually however, I slayed the dragon. I turned what was once a skeleton in a dusty closet into a warrior prepared and ready to attack anything I throw at it.
